							<h2>Magazine Subscription Rate Analysis</h2>
							<p>For this project, I used mailing demographic data to identify key variables that affect prediction response along with constructing a model in which mailing quantities can be reduced by 25% while still retaining most of the positive responses. The dataset consisted of 5,405 rows and 28 variables. 30% of the data was designated as the testing set, 70% was used as the training set.</p>
							<p>A few of these variables were adjusted prior to building the model. This includeded thirty-seven geo-demographic ordinal variables along with two categorical variables. In order to be able to use these variables as part of the model, the original values were re-scaled to the mean of their unit ranges. For the categorical variables, they were converted to dummy variables.</p>
							<p>In order to identify the best variables to use for the model, a logistic regression was executed. Then, a linear regression was performed using the variables obtained from the logistic regression to create the final model. This was done due to the nature of log-odds of responses being difficult to interpret.</p>
							<p>After constructing the model, its performance was compared to a baseline which represents the proportion of subscriptions if prospects were selected on a random basis. The differences in performance was shown in a gains chart. Using the chart, I was able to conclude that cutting mailing rates by 25% would still retain 84% of the magazine's total subscriptions.</p>

							<h2>Factor Analysis</h2>
							<p>The goal of this project is to conduct a factor analysis on U.S. census data in order to identify key factors in which the U.S is unique demographically. The purpose of this is to determine what important demographic questions to ask in future census surveys. We can identify which questions to add by finding what themes the numerous factors correlate to. The dataset consisted of 34,297 rows of data prior to cleaning.<p>
							<p>To begin, mean replacement was executed so that in the case of any missing data, some of it may still be usable. There were 920 zip-codes that had missing data, around 2.6% of the total amount of data. Thus, in order to prevent further reduction in the dataset used for analysis, non-responses were replaced with the mean distribution for the variable in question. If mean replacement was not performed, the amount of missing data would amount to 28,710 individual data points.<p>
							<p>The next step was to standardize all variables in the dataset to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The purpose of this is to make sure that variables with remarkably different scales would be able to contribute equally to the factor analysis.<p>
							<p>Now that the data is usable, it was exported to SPSS to execute the factor analysis. Varimax rotation was used in order to create a set of factors with higher holdings for each variable and was thus easier to interpret after analysis. Once executed, the factors provided by the SPSS output was interpreted to relate to five distinct themes, which are, affluence, family & home ownership, age, property value, and race.<p>
