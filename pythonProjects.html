							<h2>Real Estate Pricing Model Analysis</h2>
							<p>This project was completed with a group of peers. The purpose of this project is to determine what model would perform best when pricing for a property in the United States. The motivation behind this project is that as young adults, being able to find a place to live is something that may be extremely difficult. With this pricing analysis my peers and I hope to provide some insights that may help with this problem. The dataset that was used was extracted from Kaggle, which was sourced from the U.S Census Bureau.</p>
							<p>The dataset was first cleansed, by dropping null values, duplicate data, and irrelevant variables. Outliers were identified and removed by creating a box plot and examining the IQR values. After preparing the data, it was split with 80% being the training set, and 20% being the testing set. An exploratory analysis was then conducted, which includes the creation of a correlation matrix and examining the relationship between all relevant variables and price.</p>
							<p>Another purpose of this project was to compare the performance of different models on the data. As such, we chose to apply linear regression, decision tree regression, k-nearest neighbors regression, random rorest regression, gradient boostin regression, and a neural network regression. After creating the models, the performance of each model was measured with mean absolute error and r^2. After interpreting the results, it was determined that the top performing model was the random forest regression.</p>
